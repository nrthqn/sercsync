										More Ideas For Basim's Story<br> <br>
										The creative director for Assassin's Creed Mirage wants to further Basim's story and has ideas to do so; however, it wouldn't be in the form of DLC added to the already existing game. While another game has not been confirmed, this is something that could happen in the future, considering it is being talked about.

									Stellar Blade release time - the countdown to the new PS5 action RPG is on<br> <br>
								</pp>
								<pp1>
									If you're one of the fans who played the Stellar Blade demo enough to "scare" developer Shift Up, you'll likely know what the opening is all about. <br><br> If you don't, though, you play as Eve, a 7th Airborne Squad member who is off to Earth to aid in reclaiming it from a foe called the Naytiba. You'll start with a tutorial before hitting some enemies until you reach a boss. <br><br> The good news, though, is that you won't have to repeat that if you've played the demo as save progress carries over. 
									The opening sets the tone for the rest of the hack-and-slash adventure. <br><br> The developer behind the game hasn't been shy about calling out gameplay inspirations like Nier Automata or how Yukito Kishiro's manga Gunnm helps inform the '80s and '90s sci-fi aesthetic. The core theme, however, was inspired by a real-life taxi driver strike that left an impression on the RPG's director.

										Dragon's Dogma 2 Has Done So Well Capcom Is Paying Out More Money to Shareholders<br> <br>

								<pp>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III Season 3 Reloaded Includes Some Crazy Skins And A Lot Of Fun<br>
									<br>As they reveal in their latest blog post, this mid-season update launches on May 1, 2024, 9 AM PT, across all platforms. No exciting crossover licsenses this time, but that doesn't mean Activision hasn't prepared some crazy things.<br>
									<br>The big new weapon coming up is the BAL-27, which they describe as "A bullpup prototype weapon designed to increase fire rate over time while the trigger is squeezed. The first 4 shots are slower to fire but highly accurate."<br>
									<br>The big celebrity skin is the "DBook" Operator Skin, based on Phoenix Suns shooting guard Devin Booker. Since this game does celebrity cosplay, Booker trades in his jersey for a suit and tie, and brings a mastiff along for some Shadow Dancer style action.
